# Covid Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of Covid-19. The data spans from 2020, including details about vaccinations, cases, deaths, and recovery rates globally. The aim is to provide insights into the pandemic's progression, vaccination efforts, and the overall impact on different regions.

## Data Overview

The analysis is based on three main datasets:

1. **Covid Case Dataset**: Covers daily reported Covid-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries across various countries, providing a detailed view of the pandemic's impact.
2. **Vaccination Dataset**: Records vaccination details, including the number of doses administered, types of vaccines, and vaccination rates across countries.
3. **Covid Testing Dataset**: Comprises testing data, including the number of tests conducted and positivity rates, to analyze testing efforts and their effectiveness.

## Key Findings
